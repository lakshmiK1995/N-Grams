# N-Grams
To generate a sequence of words, the program calculates the probability that a word follows specific word/phrase. 
It randomly picks the next word based on a probability distribution -- a series of ranges that each correspond to likelihoods of occurrence. 
The size (number of words) of the phrase to use for generation is N; a statistical model created from the likelihood of N-sized phrases is called an N-gram model.
